# Bay-Healthy-Watersheds
The repository contains useful geo-spatial data on state healthy watershed designation for all seven jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay.  It's important to note that each each Bay state has a slightly different definition of a healthy watershed.  The dataset excludes WV, DE, and DC.  Designations are based on a number of jurisdictional criteria, for more information please visit:  http://www.chesapeakebay.net/channel_files/17760/state_hw_and_protection_slides.pdf

# Delaware
<strong>Healthy Watershed:</strong>
* Based primarily on water quality
* “Water Quality” includes macroinvertbrate, wetland, habitat, & riparian zone assessments
* Have 303(d) listings for low bug scores, poor habitat & degraded riparian areas
* Will have TMDLs or their equivalent for poor habitat &/or biology

<strong>Protection:</strong>
* Anti-Degradation Policy & Procedures
* Active land conservation programs (fee simple and easements)
* Natural Heritage Program (endangered & threatened species)
* Progressive land use planning in 2 of 3 counties

# Maryland
<strong>Healthy Watershed:</strong>
* High biotic diversity
* Designated as Tier II watersheds
* Brook trout watersheds
* Cold water streams
* Sentinel sites
* High fish production
* Low impervious surface
* Water quality protection
<strong>Protection:</strong>
* Direct acquisition
* Conservation easements
* Public land management
* Stewardship programs
* Antidegradation
* Watershed protection and restoration funding
* Local government planning and zoning

# Pennsylvania
<strong>Healthy Watershed:</strong>
* Special Protection Waters – Exceptional Value and High Quality
*  Category 1 and 2 waters (meeting all or some of designated uses)
<strong>Protection:</strong>
* Permitting programs
* Healthy Waters Program
* Clean Lakes Program
* Riparian Forest Buffer Initiative
* Conservation Easements
* Agricultural Conservation Plans
* Growing Greener and 319 Grant Programs
* Technical assistance

# New York
<strong>Healthy Watershed:</strong>
 No specific definition. If defining a “healthy” watershed, NYS would:
 * Evaluate if designated best uses are supported in the vast majority of waterbodies in the watershed.
 * Evaluate if the quality of the water leaving a watershed contributes to problems in watersheds downstream.
<strong>Protection:</strong>
The Waterbody Inventory/Priority
Waterbodies List provides a baseline assessment of water quality and helps NYS prioritize limited resources.

# Virginia
<strong>Healthy Watershed:</strong>
 To id and maintain high ecological integrity (stream habitat, storm water inputs, invasive species, and natural
flows), broad biodiversity, high native predators, presence of migratory fish species, low incidence of disease or parasites that provide ecosystem services and social and economic benefits
 * Multi-metric ecological assessment - physical condition of streams, habitat, fish and macro invertebrate assemblages via archival and field collected data through a probabilistic sampling approach
 * All data and the assessment methodology is available on an interactive, searchable website housed by VCU:  http://instar.vcu.edu/.
<strong>Protection:</strong>
Technical assistance, direct acquisition, conservation easements, public land management, stewardship programs, antidegredation, local government watershed planning and zoning, partnering with key NGOs to achieve the above (TNC, APNEP, land trusts, etc), changes in State Code to further facilitate the VA HWI.

# West Virginia
<strong>Healthy Watershed:</strong>
 No specific definition
<strong>Protection:</strong>
Anti-degradation, watershed protection plans, point-source regulations; voluntary nonpoint source BMPs; encouraging public involvement and protection through agency outreach and education programs and small grant programs such as WV Save Our Streams, Project Wet and Stream Partners
